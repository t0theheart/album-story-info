I chose a microservices architecture.

Reasons why choosing:
1. My own interest
2. It's popular
3. My application will be successfully divided into microservices with its own logic (The Single Responsibility Principle)

Microservices:

1. album-editor - editor, logic to create albums
2. album-player - player, logic to display and play albums
3. album-storage - albums data storage
4. album-images - albums images storage

There is a hexagonal architecture in every microservice.

HTTP is a way for communication between microservices.
